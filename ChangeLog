  General description:
	
    (1) shadow print-structure symbol which conflicts with Allegro Common
    Graphics.
	
    (2) AIMA code was disabling package locks.  It's better for the user
    to keep this mechanism activated.  It turns out that AIMA only needs
    to add one new definition to a locked symbol, so the package lock is
    now only turned off just for that one symbol.

    (3) Check if Lisp is case-sensitive.  Some AIMA code is
    case-insensitive.  While I'm sure it would be fairly easy to make AIMA
    run in a case-sensitive Lisp, it would involve many more changes than I
    felt I should make at this time.

  Specifics:

	* aima.lisp: Shadow symbol print-structure which conflicts with an
	existing symbol in Allegro Common Graphics.  Also, signal user if
	Lisp is case-sensitive since some AIMA code depends on
	case-insensitivity.
	
	* search/algorithms/iterative.lisp: Remove undefined function
	warning by adding an Allegro declaration.
	
	* utilities/cltl2.lisp: Remove Allegro package-lock override.

	* utilities/utilities.lisp: Remove Allegro package-lock override.
	Define 'while' inside Allegro without-package-locks.  Also, use
	special-operator-p instead of obsolete special-form-p.
